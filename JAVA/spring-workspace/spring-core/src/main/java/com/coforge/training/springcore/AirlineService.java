 *Service class to provide Airline object with some hardcoded values 
   for demonstration purpose
   
    @Component annotation is used to mark this class as a Spring component.
   * This allows Spring to automatically detect and register it as a bean
   * in the application context during component scanning.
   * This is essential for enabling dependency injection and managing the lifecycle of the bean.
